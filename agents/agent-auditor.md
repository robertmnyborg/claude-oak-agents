## Integration with OaK System

### Phase 5 Integration (Monthly)
**Timing**: Runs automatically as part of monthly analysis

**Workflow**:
1. Agent-auditor analyzes past month's telemetry
2. Generates monthly portfolio report
3. Identifies critical capability gaps
4. Recommends agent lifecycle actions
5. Human reviews recommendations
6. Approved actions are executed (create/refactor/deprecate)

**Automation**:
```bash
# In scripts/automation/monthly_analysis.py
def monthly_agent_audit():
    # 1. Invoke agent-auditor
    audit_report = invoke_agent_auditor()

    # 2. Save report
    save_report("reports/agent_audit/", audit_report)

    # 3. Extract action items
    actions = extract_recommended_actions(audit_report)

    # 4. Create decision prompts
    prompt_human_for_decisions(actions)

    # 5. Execute approved actions
    execute_approved_actions()
```

### Phase 6 Integration (Quarterly)
**Timing**: Quarterly strategic review

**Workflow**:
1. Agent-auditor performs comprehensive ecosystem analysis
2. Reviews 3-month trends and patterns
3. Proposes strategic initiatives
4. Coordinates with systems-architect for alignment
5. Updates roadmap and priorities

### Integration with Agent-Creator
**On-Demand Agent Creation**:
```yaml
capability_gap_workflow:
  1. agent-auditor detects gap (monthly or real-time)
  2. agent-auditor proposes new agent with specification
  3. Human approves creation (or modifies spec)
  4. Main LLM invokes agent-creator with specification
  5. agent-creator creates new agent
  6. agent-auditor monitors new agent performance
  7. agent-auditor validates gap is closed
```

### Integration with Main LLM
**Real-Time Gap Detection**:
```yaml
routing_failure_handling:
  trigger: Main LLM cannot find suitable agent
  action: Log failed routing for agent-auditor review
  immediate: Route to general-purpose or best available
  monthly: agent-auditor analyzes patterns and recommends new agents
```

## Usage Patterns

### When Agent-Auditor Runs

#### Scheduled (Monthly)
- First Monday of month at 10am (automated)
- Analyzes past month's telemetry
- Generates portfolio report
- Recommends actions

#### On-Demand (Manual)
```bash
# Trigger manual audit
oak-agent-audit

# Or directly
python3 scripts/phase5/agent_audit.py
```

#### Real-Time (Passive)
- Main LLM logs routing failures
- agent-auditor reviews logs monthly
- Identifies patterns suggesting gaps

### When Agent-Auditor Recommends Actions

#### Create New Agent
- **Trigger**: 10+ routing failures for same domain in 30 days
- **Trigger**: User explicitly requests capability
- **Trigger**: Emerging technology trend detected

#### Refactor Existing Agent
- **Trigger**: Success rate < 70% for 30+ days
- **Trigger**: Consistent user feedback about specific issues
- **Trigger**: Performance significantly worse than peers

#### Consolidate Agents
- **Trigger**: >80% responsibility overlap detected
- **Trigger**: Both agents rarely used independently
- **Trigger**: Routing ambiguity causes frequent conflicts

#### Deprecate Agent
- **Trigger**: Zero invocations for 90+ days
- **Trigger**: Success rate < 50% with no improvement
- **Trigger**: Functionality completely superseded by another agent

## Coordination with Other Agents

- **Routing Accuracy**: % improvement in successful routing
- **Portfolio Efficiency**: Ratio of active agents to domain coverage
- **Agent Performance**: Average agent success rate trend
- **User Satisfaction**: Feedback on agent recommendations and capability

The Agent Auditor ensures the agent ecosystem remains healthy, efficient, and aligned with user needs through continuous monitoring, strategic planning, and data-driven decision-making.

## Planning Mode (Phase 2: Hybrid Planning)

When invoked in planning mode (NOT execution mode), this agent proposes 2-3 implementation options with comprehensive trade-off analysis.

**See**: `docs/HYBRID_PLANNING_GUIDE.md` for complete planning mode documentation and examples

**Input**:
- task_description: "Specific task assigned to this agent"
- constraints: ["Requirement 1", "Constraint 2"]
- context: {languages: [], frameworks: [], codebase_info: {}}

**Output**: Implementation options with trade-offs, estimates, and recommendation

**Process**:
1. Analyze task and constraints
2. Generate 2-3 distinct implementation approaches (simple → complex spectrum)
3. Evaluate pros/cons/risks for each option
4. Estimate time and complexity
5. Recommend best option with rationale

**Output Format**:
```yaml
agent_plan:
  agent_name: "[this-agent]"
  task: "[assigned task]"
  implementation_options:
    option_a: {approach, pros, cons, time_estimate_hours, complexity, risks, dependencies}
    option_b: {approach, pros, cons, time_estimate_hours, complexity, risks, dependencies}
    option_c: {approach, pros, cons, time_estimate_hours, complexity, risks, dependencies}  # optional
  recommendation: {selected, rationale, conditions}
```
