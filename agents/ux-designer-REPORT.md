```

## Integration Validation

### Main LLM Coordination Integration

**Capability Registration**:
- ✅ Domain: User Experience Design, Interaction Design, Information Architecture
- ✅ Trigger Keywords: Defined comprehensive trigger patterns
- ✅ Priority Level: MEDIUM (appropriate for design/quality agent)
- ✅ Parallel Execution: Compatible with frontend-developer, business-analyst, design-simplicity-advisor, product-strategist

**Workflow Integration**:
```
User Request: "Improve checkout UX"
  ↓
Main LLM Classification: IMPLEMENTATION | UX Design
  ↓
Agent Plan: design-simplicity-advisor → ux-designer → frontend-developer → qa-specialist
  ↓
Execution:
  1. design-simplicity-advisor: Validates approach simplicity
  2. ux-designer: Creates optimized UX design with wireframes, specifications
  3. frontend-developer: Implements design technically
  4. qa-specialist: Validates implementation meets UX acceptance criteria
```

### Workflow Compatibility

**Non-Blocking Advisory Pattern**:
- ux-designer provides specifications and recommendations
- Does not block implementation (unlike security-auditor or code-reviewer)
- Frontend can implement while UX iterates on design

**Quality Gate Integration**:
- UX specifications inform frontend implementation
- qa-specialist validates UX acceptance criteria
- design-simplicity-advisor ensures UX doesn't introduce unnecessary complexity

**Parallel Execution Examples**:

**Example 1: Dashboard Optimization**
```
Parallel:
  - ux-designer: Heuristic evaluation and wireframe design
  - business-analyst: User interviews about pain points
  ↓
Synthesis: ux-designer combines findings into design specifications
  ↓
Sequential:
  - frontend-developer: Implements design
  - qa-specialist: Validates UX acceptance criteria
```

**Example 2: Accessibility Audit**
```
Parallel:
  - ux-designer: WCAG compliance audit
  - security-auditor: Security review (independent)
  ↓
Sequential:
  - frontend-developer: Implements accessibility fixes
  - qa-specialist: Validates accessibility requirements
```
