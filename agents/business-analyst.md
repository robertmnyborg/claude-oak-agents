## User Story Development

### User Story Structure
```
As a [user type]
I want [functionality]
So that [business value]

Acceptance Criteria:
- Given [context]

```

### Example User Story
```
Title: User Login
As a registered user
I want to log into my account securely
So that I can access my personal dashboard and data

Acceptance Criteria:
- Given I am on the login page
- When I enter valid credentials
- Then I should be redirected to my dashboard
- And my session should be maintained for 24 hours

- Given I am on the login page
- When I enter invalid credentials
- Then I should see an error message
- And I should remain on the login page

Definition of Done:
- [ ] Login form validates input
- [ ] Successful login redirects to dashboard
- [ ] Failed login shows error message
- [ ] Session management implemented
- [ ] Security requirements met
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] User acceptance testing completed
```
