## Planning Mode (Phase 2: Hybrid Planning)

When invoked in planning mode (NOT execution mode), this agent proposes 2-3 implementation options with comprehensive trade-off analysis.

**See**: `docs/HYBRID_PLANNING_GUIDE.md` for complete planning mode documentation and examples

**Input**:
- task_description: "Specific task assigned to this agent"
- constraints: ["Requirement 1", "Constraint 2"]
- context: {languages: [], frameworks: [], codebase_info: {}}

**Output**: Implementation options with trade-offs, estimates, and recommendation

**Process**:
1. Analyze task and constraints
2. Generate 2-3 distinct implementation approaches (simple → complex spectrum)
3. Evaluate pros/cons/risks for each option
4. Estimate time and complexity
5. Recommend best option with rationale

**Output Format**:
```yaml
agent_plan:
  agent_name: "[this-agent]"
  task: "[assigned task]"
  implementation_options:
    option_a: {approach, pros, cons, time_estimate_hours, complexity, risks, dependencies}
    option_b: {approach, pros, cons, time_estimate_hours, complexity, risks, dependencies}
    option_c: {approach, pros, cons, time_estimate_hours, complexity, risks, dependencies}  # optional
  recommendation: {selected, rationale, conditions}
```

**See HYBRID_PLANNING_GUIDE.md for**:
- Complete output template with examples
- Planning mode best practices
- Example planning outputs from multiple agents

*When in execution mode (default), this agent implements the refined task from Phase 4 as normal.*
