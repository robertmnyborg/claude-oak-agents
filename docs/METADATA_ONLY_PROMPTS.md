# Metadata-Only System Prompts: Deep Dive

## Overview

Anthropic's Agent Skills architecture uses a **progressive disclosure** approach where only lightweight metadata is loaded into the system prompt at startup, with full agent definitions loaded on-demand when needed.

OaK Agents now implements this same pattern for dramatic efficiency gains.

## The Problem: Prompt Bloat

### Traditional Approach (Heavy)

```python
# Load ALL agent definitions into system prompt
system_prompt = """
You have access to the following agents:

## Frontend Developer
<full 500-line agent definition>

## Backend Architect
<full 600-line agent definition>

## Security Auditor
<full 800-line agent definition>

... (29 more agents)
"""

# Result: 50-100KB system prompt
# Problem: Context window waste, slower inference, higher costs
```

**Issues**:
- ❌ 50-100KB of agent definitions loaded every conversation
- ❌ Most agents never used in a given conversation
- ❌ Slower LLM inference (more context to process)
- ❌ Higher token costs
- ❌ Doesn't scale beyond ~50 agents

### Metadata-Only Approach (Lightweight)

```python
# Load ONLY metadata into system prompt
system_prompt = """
You have access to the following agents (load full definition when needed):

## Frontend Developer
- Triggers: [react, vue, ui, frontend, component]
- Domains: [frontend-development]
- Priority: medium
- Capabilities: [ui_implementation, browser_compat, responsive_design]

## Backend Architect
- Triggers: [api, database, backend, server, microservices]
- Domains: [backend-development]
- Priority: medium
- Capabilities: [api_design, database_schema, system_architecture]

... (29 more agents - metadata only)
"""

# Result: 5-10KB system prompt
# Benefit: 90%+ reduction, instant classification
```

**Advantages**:
- ✅ 5-10KB system prompt (90% reduction)
- ✅ Full definitions loaded only when agent is invoked
- ✅ Faster classification (less context)
- ✅ Lower token costs
- ✅ Scales to 100+ agents easily

## How It Works

### 3-Level Progressive Disclosure

```
Level 1: STARTUP (Always Loaded)
├─ Agent name
├─ Trigger keywords (5-15)
├─ File patterns
├─ Domains
├─ Priority
└─ Capabilities list

Level 2: INVOCATION (Loaded on-demand)
├─ Full agent definition (markdown)
├─ Operating instructions
├─ Context awareness
└─ Coordination patterns

Level 3: EXECUTION (Loaded as needed)
├─ Bundled scripts
├─ Reference documentation
├─ Code templates
└─ Historical metrics
```

### Agent Discovery Flow

```
1. User Request: "Fix security vulnerability in auth endpoint"
   ↓
2. Main LLM Classification (using Level 1 metadata only)
   - Extract keywords: ["security", "vulnerability", "auth"]
   - Match against agent triggers
   - Best match: security-auditor (triggers include "security", "vulnerability", "auth")
   ↓
3. Agent Selection Decision
   - Selected: security-auditor
   - Confidence: High (multiple keyword matches)
   ↓
4. Load Level 2 (Full Definition)
   - Read agents/security-auditor/agent.md
   - Parse complete instructions
   ↓
5. Execute Agent
   - Agent has full context
   - Can access Level 3 resources as needed
```

### Concrete Example

**Level 1 Metadata** (always in prompt):
```yaml
name: security-auditor
triggers:
  keywords: [security, vulnerability, audit, compliance, penetration, threat, cve, exploit]
  file_patterns: ["*.security", "security.yml", "**/security/**"]
  domains: [security, compliance, penetration-testing]
priority: high
capabilities: [vulnerability_detection, compliance_validation, penetration_testing]
```

**Level 2 Full Definition** (loaded when invoked):
```markdown
# Security Auditor Agent

## Purpose
Comprehensive security analysis specialist...

## Core Responsibilities
1. Vulnerability Detection - SQL injection, XSS, etc.
2. Penetration Testing Strategy - Attack vector mapping
3. Compliance Validation - SOC 2, PCI DSS, GDPR

... (full 800-line definition)
```

**Level 3 Resources** (loaded as used):
```
agents/security-auditor/
  scripts/dependency_scan.py     # Loaded when script needed
  reference/owasp_top_10.md      # Loaded when referenced
  templates/security_test.py     # Loaded when used
```

## Implementation in OaK

### Metadata File Structure

```yaml
# agents/security-auditor/metadata.yaml

# LEVEL 1: Always loaded (compact)
name: security-auditor
version: 2.0.0
description: One-line summary for quick reference

triggers:
  keywords:  # 5-15 carefully chosen keywords
    - security
    - vulnerability
    - audit
    - compliance
    - penetration
    - threat
    - cve
    - exploit
    - injection
    - authentication

  file_patterns:  # Patterns that suggest this agent is relevant
    - "*.security"
    - "security.yml"
    - "SECURITY.md"
    - "**/security/**"

  domains:  # High-level domain classifications
    - security
    - compliance
    - penetration-testing

category: quality-security
priority: high
blocking: true

capabilities:  # What agent can do (for ML recommendations)
  - vulnerability_detection
  - compliance_validation
  - penetration_testing
  - threat_modeling

# LEVEL 2: Loaded on-demand (not in system prompt)
# → Full agent definition in agent.md

# LEVEL 3: Loaded as needed (not in system prompt)
scripts: [dependency_scan, secrets_detector, threat_modeler]
reference_docs: [owasp_top_10, compliance_checklists]
```

### Agent Loader Implementation

```python
class AgentLoader:
    def load_all_metadata(self) -> Dict[str, AgentMetadata]:
        """Load Level 1 metadata for all agents (lightweight)"""
        metadata = {}

        for agent_path in self.agents_dir.iterdir():
            # Load only metadata.yaml (Level 1)
            meta = self._load_metadata(agent_path / "metadata.yaml")
            metadata[meta.name] = meta

        return metadata  # 5-10KB total

    def load_agent(self, agent_name: str) -> Agent:
        """Load Level 2 definition on-demand"""
        # Only called when agent is actually invoked
        agent_def = self._load_definition(agent_name / "agent.md")
        return agent_def  # 30-100KB per agent

    def load_script(self, agent_name: str, script_name: str):
        """Load Level 3 resources as needed"""
        # Only called when script is executed
        return self._load_script(agent_name / f"scripts/{script_name}.py")
```

### System Prompt Generation

```python
def generate_system_prompt() -> str:
    """Generate lightweight system prompt with metadata only"""

    loader = AgentLoader(agents_dir)
    metadata = loader.load_all_metadata()  # Level 1 only

    prompt = "Available agents (full definitions loaded on-demand):\n\n"

    for agent in metadata.values():
        prompt += f"## {agent.name}\n"
        prompt += f"- Triggers: {', '.join(agent.triggers['keywords'][:5])}\n"
        prompt += f"- Domains: {', '.join(agent.triggers['domains'])}\n"
        prompt += f"- Priority: {agent.priority}\n\n"

    prompt += "\n**Load full definition when invoking agent**\n"

    return prompt  # 5-10KB total (vs 50-100KB with full definitions)
```

## Performance Comparison

### Metrics

| Metric | Full Definitions | Metadata-Only | Improvement |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|-------------|
| System Prompt Size | 87KB | 6KB | **93% smaller** |
| Agents Supported | ~30 (practical limit) | 100+ | **3x+ scalability** |
| Classification Speed | ~2s | ~0.5s | **4x faster** |
| Token Cost (per conversation) | ~87K tokens | ~6K tokens | **93% savings** |
| Memory Usage | High | Low | **Minimal footprint** |

### Scalability

```
Full Definitions Approach:
- 29 agents × 3KB avg = 87KB system prompt
- 50 agents × 3KB avg = 150KB system prompt  ⚠️ Too large
- 100 agents × 3KB avg = 300KB system prompt  ❌ Breaks context window

Metadata-Only Approach:
- 29 agents × 200 bytes = 5.8KB system prompt  ✅
- 100 agents × 200 bytes = 20KB system prompt  ✅ Still efficient
- 500 agents × 200 bytes = 100KB system prompt  ✅ Feasible
```

## Trigger Design Best Practices

### Keyword Selection

**Good Keywords** (specific, actionable):
```yaml
security-auditor:
  keywords:
    - security
    - vulnerability
    - audit
    - compliance
    - penetration
    - threat
    - cve
    - exploit
```

**Bad Keywords** (too generic):
```yaml
security-auditor:
  keywords:
    - code      # Too generic
    - fix       # Too generic
    - problem   # Too generic
```

### File Pattern Design

**Effective Patterns**:
```yaml
security-auditor:
  file_patterns:
    - "*.security"              # Explicit security config
    - "security.yml"            # Security manifest
    - "**/security/**"          # Security directory
    - "**/auth/**"              # Authentication code
    - "**/*_test_security.py"   # Security tests
```

**Anti-Patterns**:
```yaml
security-auditor:
  file_patterns:
    - "*.py"      # Too broad
    - "**/*"      # Matches everything
```

### Domain Classification

**Well-Defined Domains**:
```yaml
domains:
  - security             # Clear primary domain
  - compliance           # Related subdomain
  - penetration-testing  # Specialized area
```

**Overlapping Domains** (avoid):
```yaml
domains:
  - security
  - code-review   # Too broad overlap with code-reviewer agent
  - testing       # Overlaps with qa-specialist
```

## Classification Algorithm

### Keyword Matching

```python
def match_agent_by_keywords(user_request: str, agents: List[Agent]) -> List[Tuple[Agent, float]]:
    """Match agents based on keyword presence"""

    request_words = user_request.lower().split()
    matches = []

    for agent in agents:
        score = 0

        # Check trigger keywords
        for keyword in agent.triggers['keywords']:
            if keyword.lower() in user_request.lower():
                score += 10  # High weight for keyword match

        # Check capabilities
        for capability in agent.capabilities:
            cap_words = capability.replace('_', ' ')
            if cap_words in user_request.lower():
                score += 5  # Medium weight for capability match

        if score > 0:
            confidence = min(score / 20, 1.0)  # Normalize to 0-1
            matches.append((agent, confidence))

    # Sort by confidence
    matches.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

    return matches
```

### File Pattern Matching

```python
def match_agent_by_file(file_path: str, agents: List[Agent]) -> List[Agent]:
    """Match agents based on file path patterns"""

    matches = []

    for agent in agents:
        for pattern in agent.triggers['file_patterns']:
            if fnmatch.fnmatch(file_path, pattern):
                matches.append(agent)
                break

    return matches
```

### Domain Matching

```python
def match_agent_by_domain(domain: str, agents: List[Agent]) -> List[Agent]:
    """Match agents based on domain classification"""

    return [
        agent for agent in agents
        if domain.lower() in [d.lower() for d in agent.triggers['domains']]
    ]
```

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Backward Compatibility (Current)

```python
# Support both formats
def load_agent_prompt(agent):
    if has_metadata(agent):
        # New: Metadata-only in prompt
        return generate_metadata_summary(agent)
    else:
        # Old: Full definition in prompt
        return load_full_definition(agent)
```

### Phase 2: Hybrid Approach

```python
# Metadata-only for new agents, full for legacy
system_prompt = f"""
{load_metadata_for_new_agents()}

Legacy agents (full definitions):
{load_full_definitions_for_legacy_agents()}
"""
```

### Phase 3: Full Migration

```python
# All agents use metadata-only
system_prompt = load_all_metadata()  # 5-10KB

# Full definitions loaded on-demand
when agent_invoked:
    full_def = load_agent_definition(agent_name)
```

## Should You Use Metadata-Only Prompts?

### ✅ Use Metadata-Only When:

1. **You have 20+ agents** - Significant prompt size reduction
2. **Scaling to 50+ agents** - Necessary for scalability
3. **Token costs matter** - 90%+ reduction in prompt tokens
4. **Classification speed important** - Faster with less context
5. **Agent discovery needs improvement** - Better trigger matching

### ❌ Stick with Full Definitions When:

1. **You have <10 agents** - Overhead not worth it
2. **Agents are simple** - Full definitions already small
3. **No scaling planned** - Current approach works fine
4. **Migration cost high** - Time/effort not justified

## OaK Implementation Status
