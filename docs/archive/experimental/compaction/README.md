# Compaction Feature - Experimental Archive

**Archive Date**: 2025-10-21
**Status**: Experimental / Not in Production
**Reason**: No production usage found, feature not integrated

---

## What Was Compaction?

A context compression utility designed to compress verbose agent outputs for efficient handoffs between agents.

**Goal**: Reduce token usage when passing context between agents
- Research output: 2000 lines → ~100 lines (20x compression)
- Implementation output: 5000 lines → ~100 lines (50x compression)
- Plans: 1000 lines → ~50 lines (20x compression)

**Approach**: Extract key information (decisions, findings, artifacts) while discarding verbose explanations

## Archived Files (8 files)

### Core Implementation
- `compaction.py` - Main compression implementation
- `test_compaction.py` - Unit tests
- `validate_compaction.py` - Validation script

### Documentation
- `COMPACTION_README.md` - Feature documentation
- `COMPACTION_QUICK_START.md` - Quick start guide
- `COMPACTION_SUMMARY.md` - Feature summary
- `INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Integration instructions

### Examples
- `compaction_workflow.py` - Example workflow (from examples/)

## Why Archived?

### Analysis Findings

**Production Usage**: NONE FOUND
- No imports found in production code
- Only self-referential imports (compaction importing compaction tests)
- Not mentioned in main README.md or QUICK_START.md
- Not integrated with any agents

**Completeness**: IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE
- Fully functional code with tests
- Comprehensive documentation (3 MD files)
- Example workflows provided

**Conclusion**: Well-implemented experimental feature that was never integrated into production workflow

---

## Decision Rationale

Following **KISS principle** and **YAGNI** (You Aren't Gonna Need It):

✅ **Archive Rather Than Delete**:
- Code is complete and well-documented
- May have future value
- Can be restored easily from git if needed
- Preserves historical development work

❌ **Don't Keep in Core**:
- Not currently used
- Adds maintenance burden
- Clutters core/ directory
- No integration plan documented

---

## Potential Future Use Cases

If agent output verbosity becomes a problem:

1. **Token Cost Optimization**:
   - Agents generating extremely long outputs
   - Expensive context passing between agents
   - Need to reduce Claude API costs

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Speed up agent handoffs
   - Reduce processing time for long outputs
   - Improve workflow efficiency

3. **Quality Improvement**:
   - Focus on key information
   - Remove unnecessary verbosity
   - Cleaner agent-to-agent communication

---

## Restoration Guide

### Quick Restore
```bash
# Copy back to core/
cp docs/archive/experimental/compaction/*.py ~/Projects/claude-oak-agents/core/
cp docs/archive/experimental/compaction/*.md ~/Projects/claude-oak-agents/core/

# Or restore from git
git log --all --full-history -- core/compaction.py
git checkout <commit-hash> -- core/compaction.py
```

### Integration Steps (If Restoring)

1. **Add to Agent Workflows**:
   - Modify agents to compress outputs before handoff
   - Update project-manager to use compressed summaries

2. **Update Documentation**:
   - Add compaction to README.md features
   - Document when/how to use compression
   - Add to agent integration guides

3. **Test Integration**:
   - Verify compression doesn't lose critical information
   - Measure token savings
   - Validate agent handoffs still work

4. **Monitor Impact**:
   - Track compression ratios
   - Measure token cost reduction
   - Ensure quality not degraded

## Technical Details

### Compression Algorithm

**Extraction Strategy**:
1. Identify document structure (sections, headings)
2. Extract key information:
   - Decisions made
   - Findings/insights
   - Action items
   - Artifacts generated
3. Remove:
   - Verbose explanations
   - Examples and demonstrations
   - Repeated information
   - Process descriptions

**Output Format**:
```markdown
# Compressed Summary

## Key Decisions
[Bullet points of decisions]

## Critical Findings
[Essential insights only]

## Artifacts
[List of files/outputs generated]

## Next Steps
[Required follow-up actions]
```

### Dependencies

**None!** - Uses Python stdlib only:
- `re` - Regular expressions for pattern matching
- `os` - File operations
- `json` - Data serialization

No external dependencies required.

## Related Features

**Active Features** (Not Archived):
- **Dynamic Agent Discovery** (`core/agent_loader.py`, `core/generate_agent_metadata.py`)
  - Metadata-only system prompts (93% smaller context)
  - On-demand agent loading
  - Status: ✅ Production ready

**Difference**:
- **Compaction**: Compress agent *outputs* during runtime
- **Dynamic Discovery**: Reduce agent *definition* size at load time

Both aim to reduce token usage but at different stages of the workflow.
