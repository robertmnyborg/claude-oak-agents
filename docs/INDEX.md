## Quick Start

### For Everyone (5 Minutes)

**Installation**:
```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/robertmnyborg/claude-oak-agents.git ~/Projects/claude-oak-agents
cd ~/Projects/claude-oak-agents

# 2. Link agents
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents
ln -s ~/Projects/claude-oak-agents/agents/* ~/.claude/agents/

# 3. Install automation (optional)
./automation/install_automation.sh
```

**First Use**:
- Just use Claude Code normally
- Agents work automatically
- No configuration needed

**Next Steps**:
- **PM**: Read [PM Quick Start](PM_QUICK_START.md)
- **Engineer**: Read [User Guide](../USER_GUIDE.md)
- **Researcher**: Read [OaK Architecture](oak-design/OAK_ARCHITECTURE.md)

A self-learning agent system for Claude Code that provides 29+ specialized AI assistants for software development.

**Key Features**:
- **Specialized Agents** - Frontend, backend, security, infrastructure, PM, etc.
- **Auto Learning** - Tracks patterns and improves over time
- **Quality Gates** - Automatic checks before commits
- **Gap Detection** - Creates new agents when needed
- **Workflow Tracking** - Links multi-agent coordination
