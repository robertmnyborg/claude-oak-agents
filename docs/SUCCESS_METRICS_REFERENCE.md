## Health Status Indicators

### Per Agent
- ðŸŸ¢ **Green**: Success rate >85%, false completion <10%, improving trend
- ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow**: Success rate 70-85%, false completion 10-20%, stable
- ðŸ”´ **Red**: Success rate <70%, false completion >20%, declining trend

### System-Wide
- ðŸŸ¢ **Green**: >90% agents in green, false completions declining
- ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow**: 70-90% agents in green, false completions stable
- ðŸ”´ **Red**: <70% agents in green, false completions increasing

## Monthly Success Checklist

At the end of each month, check:

- [ ] False completion rate decreased or <5%
- [ ] First-time success rate increased or >90%
- [ ] Average user satisfaction >4.0
- [ ] Time to resolution decreased or <48 hours
- [ ] At least 1 agent improvement applied and validated
- [ ] No agents in "red" status for >2 weeks
- [ ] User confidence in system is stable or improving
- [ ] System generated improvement proposals for review

**If 6+ items checked**: âœ… System is successfully adapting

## Key Insight

**The adaptive system is working if**:
- You're asking for the same thing less often
- Agents complete tasks correctly on first try more often
- You trust the system more over time
- The data confirms your intuition

**Simple test**: If you had to repeat a request 3 times last month, and now you only repeat once (or not at all), the system is adapting successfully.
