- **File Structure**: Agents in `agents/`, commands in `commands/`, hooks in `hooks/`
- **Documentation**: Updated README.md with plugin installation instructions
- **Agent Count**: Updated from "24 specialized agents" to "29 specialized agents"

### Removed - Legacy Installation System
- Bootstrap installation scripts (install.sh, backup.sh, restore.sh)
- .clauderc shell integration (replaced by plugin system)
- Manual file copying workflows (replaced by plugin installation)
- Legacy .claude/disabled_agents/ structure

### Migration Guide
**From 1.x to 2.0.0 (Plugin Architecture):**
1. Uninstall existing configuration if present
2. Clone the plugin repository
3. Add as local marketplace: `/plugin marketplace add ./claude-squad-plugin`
4. Install plugin: `/plugin install claude-squad@local`
5. Deploy system: `/squad-deploy`
