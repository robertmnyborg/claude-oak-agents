# OaK Agents: User Guide for Non-Technical Users

**A Friendly Introduction to AI Agents That Get Smarter Over Time**

---

## 🤔 What Is This?

Imagine having a team of **specialized AI assistants** who help with your software development work. Each assistant is an expert in something specific:

- **Sarah** specializes in website interfaces (frontend development)
- **Marcus** is your security expert who finds vulnerabilities
- **Priya** handles server and database work (backend)
- **Alex** manages your cloud infrastructure

But here's what makes OaK Agents special: **They learn from experience and get better over time**, automatically adapting to YOUR specific needs.

---

## 🎯 Who Is This For?

### Perfect For You If:

- ✅ You use **Claude Code** for software development
- ✅ You work on **multiple types of projects** (web apps, mobile, APIs, etc.)
- ✅ You want **faster, more specialized help** instead of general-purpose AI
- ✅ You're curious about **AI that learns from your patterns**
- ✅ You want to **save time and reduce repetitive explanations**

### Not Just for Experts!

You don't need to be a machine learning expert or AI researcher. If you can:
- Install software on your computer (5 minutes)
- Use Claude Code for coding
- Run a few simple commands

...then you can use OaK Agents!

---

## 💡 What Problem Does This Solve?

### The Problem: General-Purpose AI Gets Repetitive

When you use regular Claude Code:

1. **You explain the same things repeatedly**
   - "Remember, I prefer React over Vue"
   - "Don't forget to check for security issues"
   - "Make sure tests pass before committing"

2. **Context gets lost between sessions**
   - Claude doesn't remember your patterns
   - You start from scratch each time
   - No learning from past interactions

3. **No specialization**
   - One AI tries to do everything
   - Jack of all trades, master of none
   - Slower because it's not focused

### The Solution: Specialized Agents That Learn

With OaK Agents:

1. **Specialized experts handle their domain**
   - Frontend specialist knows React patterns cold
   - Security auditor focuses only on vulnerabilities
   - Each agent is a true expert

2. **System learns from your patterns**
   - Tracks what works and what doesn't
   - Adapts to YOUR coding style
   - Gets better the more you use it

3. **Automatic optimization**
   - Identifies gaps in coverage
   - Creates new specialists when needed
   - Self-improves based on data

## 🚀 Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Building a Secure Web App

**Without OaK Agents**:
```
You: "Build a login page"
Claude: [Creates basic login]

You: "Make sure it's secure"
Claude: [Adds some security]

You: "Check for SQL injection"
Claude: [Reviews code]

You: "Don't forget XSS protection"
Claude: [Adds XSS checks]

You: "Review for other vulnerabilities"
Claude: [Another review...]
```

**With OaK Agents**:
```
You: "Build a login page"
→ frontend-developer creates the UI
→ security-auditor automatically reviews for:
   ✓ SQL injection
   ✓ XSS vulnerabilities
   ✓ Authentication flaws
   ✓ OWASP Top 10 issues
→ All done in one go, no reminders needed!
```

**Time saved**: 70% (10 minutes → 3 minutes)

---

### Example 2: Deploying to Cloud

**Without OaK Agents**:
```
You: "Deploy to AWS"
Claude: [Creates basic deployment]

You: "Make sure it scales"
[You realize later it doesn't scale well]

You: "Add monitoring"
[You add monitoring after deployment]

You: "Check security settings"
[You discover security issues in production]
```

**With OaK Agents**:
```
You: "Deploy to AWS"
→ infrastructure-specialist handles deployment
→ performance-optimizer ensures scalability
→ security-auditor checks cloud config
→ systems-architect validates architecture
→ All coordinated automatically!
```

**Benefit**: Fewer production issues, better architecture from the start

---

### Example 3: Code Review Before Commit

**Without OaK Agents**:
```
You: "Review this code"
Claude: [General review]

You: "Check for performance issues"
Claude: [Separate review]

You: "Make sure tests exist"
Claude: [Another review]

You: "Simplify if possible"
Claude: [Yet another review...]
```

**With OaK Agents**:
```
You: Ready to commit your code
→ code-reviewer checks quality
→ performance-optimizer scans for bottlenecks
→ unit-test-expert ensures test coverage
→ security-auditor finds vulnerabilities
→ design-simplicity-advisor suggests simplifications
→ All happen automatically before you commit!
```

**Quality improvement**: Catches 3-5x more issues before they reach production

## 🎓 How to Get Started

### Step 1: Install (5 Minutes)

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/robertmnyborg/claude-oak-agents.git ~/Projects/claude-oak-agents
cd ~/Projects/claude-oak-agents

# 2. Install agents (creates shortcuts)
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents
ln -s ~/Projects/claude-oak-agents/agents/* ~/.claude/agents/

# 3. Install automation (optional but recommended)
./automation/install_automation.sh

# That's it! You're ready to use agents
```

### Step 2: Use Normally (No Learning Curve!)

Just use Claude Code as you normally would:

```
You: "Build a secure login page"
```

Behind the scenes:
- System automatically picks the right agents
- frontend-developer builds the UI
- security-auditor reviews for vulnerabilities
- All coordinated automatically

**You don't need to learn anything new!**

### Step 3: Review Insights (15 Minutes/Week)

Once a week, review what the system learned:

```bash
oak-weekly-review
```

See:
- What agents were used most
- What worked well
- What could improve
- Performance trends

**Optional**: Most users just let it run automatically!

## 🤷 Common Questions

### "Do I need to configure anything?"

**Nope!** It works out of the box. All configuration is optional and for power users.

### "What if I don't like an agent's work?"

The system learns from your feedback. If you modify or reject an agent's output, it learns not to do that again.

### "Will it replace my coding skills?"

No! Agents are **assistants**, not replacements. They handle:
- Repetitive quality checks
- Pattern detection
- Specialized analysis

You still:
- Make architecture decisions
- Write business logic
- Review and approve outputs

### "What if I work on different types of projects?"

Perfect! The system adapts to YOUR patterns:
- Mostly web development? Gets great at that
- Switch to mobile? Creates mobile specialists
- Do data science? Adapts to that too

### "How much does it cost?"

**Free and open source!**

Costs are only Claude API usage:
- **With optimizations**: ~$12/month saved
- No subscription fees
- No hidden costs

### "Is my code data private?"

**Yes, 100% local.**
- All data stays on your computer
- No external servers
- No data sent anywhere
- You control everything
