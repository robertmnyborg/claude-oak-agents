## Purpose of Product Spec 2

This specification defines **WHAT** needs to be built and **WHY**, without prescribing **HOW** to build it. It serves as the handoff document from Product to Engineering, providing enough context for a Principal Engineer to design the technical solution.

### What This Spec DOES Include:
✅ Business problem and user needs
✅ Functional requirements and acceptance criteria
✅ Inputs (user interactions, data sources, external systems)
✅ Outputs (UI components, API endpoints, user experiences)
✅ Success metrics and validation criteria
✅ Constraints and dependencies

### What This Spec DOES NOT Include:
❌ Code structures, class hierarchies, or implementation details
❌ Specific programming languages or framework choices
❌ Database schemas, table definitions, or migration scripts
❌ System architecture diagrams or infrastructure design
❌ Detailed technical implementation steps

### 1.2 Current State
[Describe how things work today. What are the limitations or pain points?]

### 1.3 Desired Future State

## Notes for Principal Engineer

When designing the technical solution from this spec, please:

1. **Choose appropriate technologies** based on your expertise and team capabilities
2. **Design data models** that best support the requirements (schemas not specified here)
3. **Define system architecture** that balances simplicity, scalability, and maintainability
4. **Propose alternatives** if you see a better approach to meeting the requirements
5. **Ask questions** if anything is unclear or ambiguous

This spec intentionally avoids implementation details to give engineering flexibility in technical decisions. The goal is to align on WHAT we're building and WHY, leaving HOW to your expertise.
