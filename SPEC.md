✅ Functional requirements and workflows
✅ Inputs (user interactions, data sources, agent invocations)
✅ Outputs (agent behaviors, specifications, telemetry, reports)
✅ Success metrics and learning mechanisms
✅ Constraints and integration patterns

### What This Spec DOES NOT Include:
❌ Code structures, class hierarchies, or implementation details
❌ Specific programming languages or framework choices
❌ Database schemas, table definitions, or migration scripts
❌ System architecture diagrams with technical specifics
❌ Detailed technical implementation steps

## 1. Problem Statement

### 1.1 Business Context
**What problem are we solving?**

Product managers and semi-technical teams need to prototype features, design systems, and create engineering-ready specifications without becoming expert developers. Current AI assistants are generalized and don't learn from project-specific patterns, leading to:

- Repetitive explanations of domain context
- Inconsistent code quality across features
- Manual quality checks before every commit
- Difficulty translating business requirements to technical specs
- No learning or improvement over time

**Why now?**

Claude Code provides an extension system for AI agents, but lacks:
- Specialized domain expertise (frontend, backend, security, etc.)
- Learning mechanisms that improve with usage
- Automatic quality gates and coordination
- PM-friendly specification workflows

### 1.2 Current State
Users work with a single generalized AI assistant that:
- Requires full context on every interaction
- Doesn't specialize in specific domains
- Provides no automatic quality validation
- Cannot learn from past interactions
- Offers no structured workflows for complex tasks

### 1.3 Desired Future State
Users interact with a self-learning team of specialized AI agents that:
- Automatically route tasks to domain experts
- Learn optimal agent selection from past successes
- Run automatic quality gates before commits
- Support PM-friendly specification workflows
- Improve performance over time through telemetry
- Detect capability gaps and propose new agents

## 6. Assumptions & Open Questions

### 6.1 Assumptions

We're proceeding based on these assumptions (validate during technical design):

- **Assumption 1**: Users have Claude Code installed and configured with API access
- **Assumption 2**: Users work in git-initialized projects for version control features
- **Assumption 3**: Append-only telemetry logs are sufficient for learning (no need for database queries)
- **Assumption 4**: File-based storage scales to hundreds of invocations before performance issues
- **Assumption 5**: Offline learning provides sufficient improvement without real-time RL
- **Assumption 6**: Users will provide feedback on agent performance when prompted

### 6.2 Open Questions

Questions that need answers before or during implementation:

- [ ] **Q1**: How many telemetry entries before file-based storage becomes problematic?
  - **Impact**: Determines if archival/compression strategy needed
  - **Owner**: Technical architect during implementation

- [ ] **Q2**: What's the optimal frequency for prompting user feedback without being annoying?
  - **Impact**: Affects learning rate vs user experience
  - **Owner**: Product lead based on user testing

- [ ] **Q3**: Should agent definitions support versioning for A/B testing?
  - **Impact**: Enables systematic comparison of agent improvements
  - **Owner**: Technical architect

- [ ] **Q4**: How to handle cross-project learning (patterns from Project A inform Project B)?
  - **Impact**: Could significantly improve learning effectiveness
  - **Owner**: Future enhancement - out of scope for initial implementation

---

## 7. Security & Privacy Considerations

### 7.1 Data Sensitivity

- **Telemetry data** - Contains task descriptions, file paths, code snippets (Confidential)
- **Specification files** - Contains business requirements, technical designs (Confidential)
- **Agent definitions** - Contains system prompts, agent instructions (Internal)
- **Performance statistics** - Contains aggregated metrics (Internal)

**All data stored locally, never transmitted externally except through Claude API as part of conversation context**

### 7.2 Authentication & Authorization

- **Who can access**: Users with file system access to project directory
- **Authentication required**: No (local file system permissions sufficient)
- **Permission model**: File system permissions control access

### 7.3 Compliance Requirements

- **Privacy**: No PII collected unless user includes in task descriptions (user responsibility)
- **Data Retention**: Users control retention (delete telemetry files at will)
- **Transparency**: All logging is transparent and documented

---

## 8. Performance & Scalability

### 8.1 Performance Requirements

- **Response Time**: Agent classification completes within 1-2 seconds
- **Throughput**: System handles 50+ agent invocations per day per user
- **Specification Creation**: PM workflows complete in 30-60 minutes
- **Report Generation**: Weekly reports generate in under 5 seconds
- **Quality Gates**: Combined quality gate validation completes in 5-15 seconds

### 8.2 Scalability Requirements

- **User Growth**: System works for individual developers up to medium teams (10-20 people)
- **Data Growth**: Telemetry logs scale to thousands of entries before requiring optimization
- **Agent Portfolio**: System supports 50-100 specialized agents
- **Workflow Complexity**: Handles workflows with up to 10 agent coordinations

## Changelog

### [2025-10-24] - Initial Draft
- Created comprehensive Product Spec 2 for claude-oak-agents system
- Focused on INPUTS (user interactions, data sources, configuration) and OUTPUTS (agent behaviors, specifications, telemetry, reports)
- Followed deployment-manager rules: NO implementation details, NO database schemas, NO code structures
- Referenced data sources without implementation specifics
- Described functional requirements and data flows only

## Notes for Principal Engineer

When designing the technical solution from this spec, please:

1. **Choose appropriate technologies** based on your expertise and team capabilities (file formats, data structures, scripting languages)
2. **Design data models** that best support the requirements (telemetry schemas, specification formats not specified here)
3. **Define system architecture** that balances simplicity, scalability, and maintainability (file-based vs database, synchronous vs async)
4. **Propose alternatives** if you see a better approach to meeting the requirements (different coordination patterns, learning mechanisms)
5. **Ask questions** if anything is unclear or ambiguous (validation thresholds, edge case behaviors)

This spec intentionally avoids implementation details to give engineering flexibility in technical decisions. The goal is to align on WHAT we're building and WHY, leaving HOW to your expertise.

Key areas requiring technical design:
- Telemetry data format and storage strategy
- Agent coordination mechanism (how Main LLM invokes and tracks agents)
- Specification parsing and YAML generation approach
- Quality gate execution and failure handling
- Learning algorithm for agent selection improvement
- Workflow tracking and parent-child relationship modeling
