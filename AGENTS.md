# Claude Squad Plugin - Agent System Architecture

## Overview

The Claude Squad Plugin provides **29 specialized agents** with comprehensive overlap resolution, mandatory delegation enforcement, intelligent multi-agent coordination, and direct workflow management by the Main LLM. The system eliminates agent confusion through clear domain boundaries while enabling sophisticated multi-agent collaboration for complex cross-domain tasks.

## Plugin Architecture

This system is delivered as a Claude Code plugin with the following structure:
- **29 Specialist Agents** - Domain experts in `agents/` directory
- **9 Squad Commands** - Management commands in `commands/` directory
- **Session Hooks** - Automatic rule loading in `hooks/` directory
- **Delegation Rules** - Core enforcement logic in `CLAUDE.md`

## üö® Delegation Enforcement System

### Main LLM Restrictions
The main LLM is **EXPLICITLY PROHIBITED** from:
- ‚ùå Writing, editing, or modifying any code
- ‚ùå Using Write, Edit, MultiEdit tools
- ‚ùå Performing any technical implementation work
- ‚ùå Bypassing agent delegation

**Role Restriction**: Main LLM handles coordination, communication, and delegation ONLY.

### Automatic Delegation Triggers
These patterns **FORCE** delegation with no exceptions:
- **Action verbs**: implement, create, build, fix, deploy, test, add, update, refactor, improve, design, setup, configure, analyze, optimize, migrate, integrate, write, edit, modify, develop, code
- **File operations**: ANY mention of Write, Edit, MultiEdit
- **Programming keywords**: function, class, method, variable, API, database
- **Technical implementation**: ANY technical work beyond coordination

## How the Agent System Works

### Direct Coordination Architecture

The agent system operates through **direct Main LLM coordination**:

1. **Main LLM detects task complexity**: Analyzes request for delegation triggers
2. **Direct specialist delegation**: Main LLM invokes appropriate agents via Task() calls
3. **Quality gate enforcement**: Mandatory sequential validation before commits
4. **Parallel coordination**: Multiple Task() calls in single message for efficiency
5. **Result synthesis**: Main LLM combines agent outputs and communicates with user

### Maximum Parallelism Strategy

The Main LLM maximizes parallel execution wherever possible:

#### Parallel Execution Opportunities
- **Planning Phase**: `systems-architect` + `security-auditor` + `business-analyst`
- **Analysis Phase**: `performance-optimizer` + `dependency-scanner`
- **Documentation Phase**: `content-writer` + `technical-documentation-writer`
- **Security Phase**: `security-auditor` + `code-reviewer` (independent components)

#### Sequential Dependencies (Quality Gates)
1. **Mandatory Pre-Implementation**: `design-simplicity-advisor` (blocks ALL implementation)
2. **Implementation**: Appropriate specialist agent based on domain
3. **Code Review**: `code-reviewer` (blocks progression until quality gates pass)
4. **Testing**: `unit-test-expert` (validates implementation)
5. **Pre-Commit Simplicity**: `design-simplicity-advisor` (mandatory complexity review)
6. **Git Operations**: `git-workflow-manager` + `changelog-recorder`

#### Blocking Conditions
- **HIGHEST**: `debug-specialist` (blocks ALL other agents - critical errors only)
- **MANDATORY**: `design-simplicity-advisor` (blocks ALL implementation AND git operations)
- **HIGH**: `code-reviewer` (must pass before other analysis)
- **MEDIUM**: `unit-test-expert`
- **STANDARD**: All other agents based on dependencies

### Workflow Examples

#### Code Implementation Workflow
```
1. design-simplicity-advisor (MANDATORY pre-implementation)
2. programmer/specialist (implementation with simplicity constraints)
3. code-reviewer (quality gate validation)
4. unit-test-expert (test creation and coverage)
5. design-simplicity-advisor (MANDATORY pre-commit review)
6. git-workflow-manager + changelog-recorder (parallel finalization)
```

#### Complex Multi-Agent Coordination
```
User: "Build secure payment processing with mobile support"
System coordinates:
1. design-simplicity-advisor ‚Üí simplicity-first architecture
2. systems-architect ‚Üí security-focused design
3. backend-architect ‚Üí payment API design
4. mobile-developer ‚Üí mobile payment UI
5. security-auditor ‚Üí security validation
6. qa-specialist ‚Üí comprehensive testing
7. design-simplicity-advisor ‚Üí pre-commit complexity review
```

#### Debug Priority Workflow
```
User: "Debug failing performance tests"
System coordinates:
1. debug-specialist (HIGHEST PRIORITY - blocks others)
2. performance-optimizer (analyze bottlenecks)
3. qa-specialist (test framework issues)
4. Main LLM synthesizes findings and solutions
```

### Quality Gates & Enforcement

Sequential dependencies are enforced through mandatory quality gates:

1. **Pre-Implementation Simplicity Gate**: `design-simplicity-advisor` blocks ALL implementation (MANDATORY)
2. **Security & Quality Gate**: `code-reviewer` blocks all downstream analysis
3. **Test Coverage Gate**: `unit-test-expert` blocks git operations
4. **Pre-Commit Simplicity Gate**: `design-simplicity-advisor` blocks ALL git operations (MANDATORY)
5. **Documentation Gate**: `technical-documentation-writer` (advisory, non-blocking)

### Multi-Agent Coordination Patterns

#### Coordination Types
1. **Sequential Quality Gates**: Implementation ‚Üí code-reviewer ‚Üí code-clarity-manager ‚Üí unit-test-expert ‚Üí design-simplicity-advisor ‚Üí git-workflow-manager
2. **Parallel Analysis**: security-auditor + performance-optimizer + dependency-scanner
3. **Collaborative Architecture**: systems-architect ‚Üí backend-architect + infrastructure-specialist
4. **Domain Collaboration**: Multiple specialists with Main LLM reconciliation

#### Conflict Resolution Rules
1. **Domain Priority**: More specific domain takes precedence
2. **Security First**: Security recommendations override performance/convenience
3. **Architecture Consistency**: Higher-level architecture decisions guide implementation
4. **User Requirements**: Business analyst requirements guide technical decisions
5. **Quality Gates**: Code reviewer decisions are non-negotiable

- **Security Layers**: security-auditor (auditing) + code-reviewer (quality gates) + dependency-scanner (supply chain)
- **Architecture Tiers**: systems-architect (design) + backend-architect (implementation) + infrastructure-specialist (deployment)
- **Documentation Split**: technical-documentation-writer (technical) vs content-writer (user-facing)
- **Analysis Domains**: data-scientist (data) vs performance-optimizer (performance) vs business-analyst (requirements)

#### Multi-Agent Coordination Examples

## Architecture Components

### Rule Inheritance System

#### Global Configuration
```
/Users/jamsa/.claude/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CLAUDE.md                    # Global rules and coordination logic
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ agents/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ programmer.md            # Global programming agent
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ infrastructure-specialist.md
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ security-auditor.md
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ code-reviewer.md
```

#### Local Project Overrides
```
project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .claude/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agents/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ programmer.md        # Override: Python > TypeScript > Go
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ custom-validator.md  # Project-specific agent
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CLAUDE.md                # Project-specific rules
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
```

#### Resolution Order
1. Check `./claude/agents/agent-name.md` (local project)
2. Fall back to `/Users/jamsa/.claude/agents/agent-name.md` (global)
3. Same agent name = complete override (not merge)

### Enforcement Mechanisms

#### Main LLM Restrictions
```yaml
prohibited_actions:
  - direct_programming: Cannot write/edit code
  - file_modifications: Cannot use Write/Edit/MultiEdit
  - technical_execution: Cannot perform implementation work
```

#### Agent Enforcement Reminders
Key agents include bypass detection:
```markdown
üö® ENFORCEMENT REMINDER üö®
IF MAIN LLM ATTEMPTS PROGRAMMING: This is a delegation bypass violation!
```

#### Mandatory Triggers
```yaml
mandatory_triggers:
  action_verbs: [implement, create, build, fix, etc.]
  file_operations: [Write, Edit, MultiEdit mentions]
  programming_keywords: [function, class, method, etc.]
```
